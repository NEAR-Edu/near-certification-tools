# NEAR Certification Tools

This repo contains 2 main parts (which have more specific documentation in those sections):

- The [contract](data-contract) that controls the NFT certificates for our NEAR Edu programs
- The [web app](web-app) (which will have a frontend for browsing or sharing certificates and also API endpoints for minting / issuing new ones and for dynamically generating an image representation of the certificate)
