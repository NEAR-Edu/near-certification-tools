# NEAR Certification Tools

This repo contains 2 main parts (which have more specific documentation in those sections):

- The [API](api/router) that has the API endpoints fo minting / issuing new certificates and 
  for fetching data needed for image generation as well as the contract which controls the NFT 
  certificates for our NEAR Edu programs.
- The [web app](web-app) which implements the frontend for browsing the certificates and 
  generating the NFT images for them.
